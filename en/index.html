      <p class="introduction">
        <i>Leida</i> is an online journal initiated by the Faculty of Design, Estonian Academy of Arts and is focused on publishing texts that describe, analyse and reflect upon the various facets of being human and non-human through critical visual, material and processual aspects of design. <i>Leida</i> brings together both Estonian and foreign practitioners and theorists with a background in design, crafts, architecture, visual arts or the fields in between. The journal provides a discussion platform that empowers a multiplicity of different media, disciplines and perspectives in order to ensure a level of criticality and adequacy to understand the modern person, their experience and the surrounding environment.

        <!-- <h3 class="article-title">Essay: What is Design Writing</h3> -->
        <p>
          Design is our daily companion, whose presence and ubiquity we can always be sure of in modern times, even though its boundaries may remain vague and its effects incomprehensible. Even though design is artificial and man-made, it shapes humans as well as non-humans. Following a comparison by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, design is a rhizomatic network, similar to a mycelium that spreads to different ecosystems but also moulds and permeates our physical bodies and personal feelings, original and conventional thoughts, and even the values ​​we hold close to our hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design has always had an effect on our daily lives, both public and individual, influencing how we perceive and think, how and by what means we create and interpret meanings. Although design has become the central ideology of modern everyday life, continually conquering new territories, design (and also the designer) often remains unnoticed. Many design processes have already incorporated the call for anonymity and the so-called soft impact, which further amplifies the manipulation of people and their behavioural habits. Nonetheless, there is something very organic in the way our identities are shaped by designers and consumers themselves through visual and material culture. Interfering with this seemingly functioning and natural system seems inappropriate, as that would mean going against the predominant order we have already accepted by default. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Design journal <i>Leida</i> aspires to penetrate the smooth surfaces of design to offer the possibility to retire from a world that is dulling our senses and thoughts, even if just for a second. Design should not only be part of the prevailing consumer culture, but also something to help us better understand our own bodies, feelings, thoughts and values. We need to find ways to critically address the objects, services, forms and processes that affect us but are often left unnoticed. Once noticed, we still have to learn to comprehend the impact and meaning of design because we cannot deny that the effects and meanings associated with design are ever-changing. And in our opinion, writing about design has an important role to play in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The journal’s name <i>Leida</i> refers to <i>Leida</i> Madisson, the first editor of the former almanac <i>Kunst ja Kodu</i> (<i>Art and Home</i>, published between 1958 and 1990), which originally focused exclusively on home design. In this way, we want to emphasize the importance of the journal in the context of Estonian design and the people and initiatives associated with it, who have so far been unfairly ignored. Over time, <i>Kunst ja Kodu</i> became a publication which, in addition to everyday topics, offered the opportunity to write about issues and concepts related to contemporary art, thereby also expanding discussions of questions related to the design sphere. <i>Leida</i>’s future issues also aspire to gather articles providing different perspectives, including practice-related approaches. Nonetheless, <i>Leida</i> does not aim to pay attention to single individuals but to the invisibility of design in general–either in the form of forgotten and uncredited designers or those writing about design or the proliferating masses of design that surround us, and upon which <i>Leida</i> hopes to shed light by providing us with the appropriate methods for reflecting on design.
        </p>
        <p>
          While highlighting design can be a challenge on its own, should we even talk about writing about design? We think that avoiding this subject would leave the design discourse unbalanced. Besides, design would never stop writing us, even if we denounce writing about design. Design has already started; we just have to catch up.
